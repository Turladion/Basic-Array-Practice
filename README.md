# Basic-Array-Practice
This is just me playing with arrays and values
I wanted to create a basic thing that checks the grades of three students. 
All of them are by default set to have their grade at 0
Then I go in and pass new grade values and whether they're passing into the function at the top.
"John" and "Mary" 's grades are over 75, and set to passing, whilst "David"'s is still set at a value below the 75 threshold.
